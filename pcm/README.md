Note: This PCM model of the JPetStore is substantially altered.

This PCM model is dervied from the complete setup in the jpetstore-6 repository.
As it is used as runtime model, it does not contain allocations or resource
containers. Therefore, it cannot be used to make performance assessments with it
out of the box. Only use it in conjunction with the JSS experiment.
